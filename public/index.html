      content="HLS Data Transfer Dashboard is designed to track the progress of the data transfer between the European Space Agency and NASA. The Dashboard panels are developed using Grafana, an open source analytics and interactive visualization web application. Grafana panels are organized in order using react JS with routing in place by embedding them using the iframe technique. This Grafana dashboard is connected with two data sources in the backend. One of the data sources is prometheus which is installed on all of the transfer agents (ec2-instances) and the other one is the Postgresql datasource which provides the transfer metrics. The Dashboard is classified into 4 tabs like Data Transfer Progress, health of the data, Technical Details and Transfer Queue.

      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.
